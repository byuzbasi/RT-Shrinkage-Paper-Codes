## 📑 Abstract

Multicollinearity is a common issue in regression analysis that occurs when some predictor variables are highly correlated, leading to unstable least squares estimates 
of model parameters. Various estimation strategies have been proposed to address this problem. In this study, we enhance a ridge-type estimator by incorporating pretest and 
shrinkage techniques. We conducted an analytical comparison to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators in terms of bias, quadratic risk, and numerical performance 
using both simulated and real data. Additionally, we assessed several penalization methods and three machine-learning algorithms to facilitate a comprehensive comparison. 
Our results demonstrate that the proposed estimators outperform the standard ridge-type estimator with respect to mean squared error in simulated data and mean squared 
prediction error in real data applications.

Both **Monte Carlo simulation experiments** and **real-data applications** were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators.

This repository provides full replication materials for the study:
- Parameter settings and simulation scripts.
- Empirical datasets used in the real-data analysis.
- Output summaries (bias, MSE, prediction error metrics).
